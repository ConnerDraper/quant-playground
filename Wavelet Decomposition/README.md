# Wavelet Decomposition
Welcome to the Wavelet Decomposition mini-project! Here, you'll find some neat code and resources to break down financial data using wavelet decomposition. This technique helps you analyze time series data by splitting a signal into different frequency components.

Wavelet decomposition is a versatile tool used in fields like signal processing, image compression, and financial analysis. In this project, we're applying these techniques to financial data to uncover some interesting insights.

## Installation
To get started, you'll need to install a few dependencies. Just run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
